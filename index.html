        Hello
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hi there, I'm Jonah. I'm a vagabond with some wunderlust
        who daylights as a software engineer. I'm currenly living the
        dream in Cape Town, South Africa.

        What are you looking at?
    </h2>
    <p>
        This page is pretty much a stub for when I decide to someday blog.

    <h2>
        What am I doing at the moment?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I currently work as an intern software engineer at AWS, 
        specifically in a team known as Kumo.

    <h2>
        What am I interested in?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have a diverse set of interests. Two big fields that seem to have a profound
        grip on my heart are computer science and history.
        I quite enjoy programming languages. Love picking them up. I'm also quite a
        big fan of writing AI's to enter random competitions. For some reason (most likely
        stockholm syndrom) I'm a bit of a haskeller.
