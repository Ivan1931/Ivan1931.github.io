## About Me
My name is Jonah. I live in Cape Town, South Africa.

Circa 2010, I decided to take a high school programming course. Within a week I became my families expert 
in all matters computer and had a hobby that's difficult to explain at bars.

Today I'm enrolled in the Computer Science Honours program at the University of Cape Town.
Before that I was an intern at Amazon Web Services in Cape Town in a team called Kumo.

I have a bunch of interests that are related to

* Statically typed functional programming languages
* Lisp + Scheme + SICP
* Applications of the Futumura projection
* Evolutionary computing
* Machine learning
* Reinforcement learning
* Stochastic processes
* Algorithms + Data structures
* Distributed Computing

Other honourable mentions

* Surfing
* Rock climbing
* Procrastinating on a scify short story

On a more abstract level, I'm seeking a both broad and fundamental understanding of the art and sorcery of computing.
