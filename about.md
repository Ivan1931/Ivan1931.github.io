### Hi!
I'm Jonah.

Thanks for visiting my nascent blog.

I'm a software engineer/student/traveller from South Africa.

If you have any comments, questions, requests, 
are in need of a drinking buddy in Cape Town or Johannesburg
or just want to talk about code|business|history|books then I'd love
to hear from you :)
